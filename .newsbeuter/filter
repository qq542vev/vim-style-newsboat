####  define-filter
#
# With this command, you can predefine filters, which you can later select from
# a list, and which are then applied after selection. This is especially useful
# for filters that you need often and you don't want to enter them every time
# you need them.
#
# Syntax: <name> <filterexpr>
#
# Default value: n/a
#
# define-filter "all feeds with 'fun' tag" "tags # \"fun\""

define-filter "Articles within 3 Days" "age between 0:2"
define-filter "Unread Articles" "unread = \"yes\""
define-filter "Read Articles" "unread = \"no\""
define-filter "Content Articles" "content != \"\""
define-filter "No Content Articles" "content = \"\""
define-filter "Podcast Articles" "enclosure_url != \"\" and enclosure_type =~ \"^(audio|video)/\""
define-filter "Flagged Articles" "flags != \"\""
define-filter "Unread Feeds" "unread_count > 0"
define-filter "Article Feeds" "total_count > 0"
