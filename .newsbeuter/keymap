####  unbind-key
#
# Unbind key <key>. This means that no operation is called when <key> is
# pressed. Optionally, you can specify a dialog (for a list of available
# dialogs, see `bind-key` above). If you specify one, the key binding will only
# be unbound for the specified dialog.

# Syntax: <key> [<dialog>]

# dialog. If you specify one, the key binding will only be added to the
# specified dialog. Available dialogs are `all` (default if none is specified),
# `feedlist`, `filebrowser`, `help`, `articlelist`, `article`, `tagselection`,
# `filterselection`, `urlview` and `podbeuter`.
